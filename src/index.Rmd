## Getting started {#start}

You will first need to install `R` and `Rstudio`. To do use the following links:

 - [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
 - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
 
### New to R?

There are gazillions of R tutorials online. [this seems like a good place to start](http://scs.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:_Getting_started_with_R#Starting_to_learn_R:_Tutorials_on_the_Web).

I like to use the data.table package. Here is a [tutorial](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.pdf) and a [cheatsheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf) for `data.table`

Here is a [tutorial](http://www.ceb-institute.org/bbs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/handout_ggplot2.pdf), a [cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) and the [full documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) for `ggplot2`.

You can install most packages directly:

```r
install.packages(c("devtools","data.table","ggplot2","plyr"))
```

Other packages need to be installed from github using the devtools package:

```r
require(devtools)
install_github("tlamadon/RcppSimpleTensor")
```

### Submitting Homeworks

There are 2 ways. In both cases please make sure to write who was in the group.

1. You can either fork this repo (button above), do your homework on your fork **in the .Rmd file of the homework** and submit as a pull request [on this github repo](https://github.com/floswald/ScPo-Labor)
1. Or you down just download this (again button above), and send me your homework (again, the corresponding .Rmd file which you changed with your work) as a direct message on our **Slack channel**.
